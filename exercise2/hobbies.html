                <h2>Football</h2>
                <p>I have played football since junior age in the JJK team. My position has been left defender, but occasionally I have played in the midfield as well. The best achievements have been:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>D-boys' regional championship in 2005</li>
                    <li>fsrgdhcjsdkvd</li>
                    <li>dhgkjfdf</li>
                    <li>fxbvxjnfk</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Football has been more than just a game for me; it's a lifelong passion that has taught me the value of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. I look forward to continuing my journey in football, both on and off the field.</p>

                <p>
                    Drawing has always been a creative outlet for me, providing a way to express my imagination and ideas visually. From an early age, I found joy in sketching and creating comic strips. 
                    Currently, I am exploring digital art to expand my skills and reach a broader audience. I am also working on a series of comic strips that I plan to publish online.
